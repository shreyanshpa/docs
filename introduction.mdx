title: "What is Paystream?"
---
**Maximize yield on every dollar.** That's what we're built for. Your capital should always be earning, whether that's LP fees, funding rate arbitrage, or delta-neutral yield. Paystream gives you one place to do it all on Solana.

## One Terminal, Every Yield Source

DeFi today is fragmented. Different protocols, different rates, different tools. Paystream brings it together. The [LP Terminal](/lp-terminal/what) lets you create and manage liquidity positions across Raydium and Meteora from a single interface. Single-token entry and exit. Custom strategies. No more juggling a dozen apps.

We also run **delta-neutral funding strategies** so you can earn from perpetual funding rates without betting on price. Farm funding rate gaps across perp DEXs, each with different settlement intervals. Market-neutral. Automated. Or skip the manual work and deposit into our [vault](/strategies/vault) and let the protocol handle opening, closing, and rebalancing. See [Strategies](/strategies/overview) for the full picture.

## The Edge No Single Protocol Has

**Custom LP strategies with single-click execution.** Build, deploy, and manage any LP position across Raydium and Meteora. Full control.

**Multiple strategies, one position.** LP fees, funding arb, and delta-neutral yield can run at the same time. No other tool combines all three.

**Every dollar is deployed.** Margin earns while your position is open. Collateral earns while your trade runs. Nothing sits idle.

**Built on fragmented markets.** Different rates, different intervals, across every venue. The spread is structural. So is the return.
