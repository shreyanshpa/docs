Paystream today focuses on two main areas: **delta-neutral strategies** and **liquidity provisioning** via the LP Terminal. Here’s how each works at a high level.

## Strategies

We run **delta-neutral funding strategies** so you can earn from perpetual funding rates without betting on price. You’re not going long or short directionally; you’re hedged so that price moves cancel out across your legs and you keep the funding spread.

We support two structures: **perp-to-perp** (two perpetual legs on different venues, earning the funding rate *difference*) and **spot-to-perp** (long spot and short perp to collect funding). We use Hyperliquid, Drift, Pacifica, and Lighter. Before we enter any trade we run pre-entry safety gates and a stress simulation; once in a position we use margin tiers, ADL handling, and a kill switch so one bad move doesn't blow up the book. For the full picture, see [Strategies](/strategies/overview).

**Vaults** give you the same yield without the manual work. You deposit USDC and receive **share tokens** that track your stake. The protocol deploys your capital into delta-neutral positions and rebalances automatically as funding rates shift across venues — opening, closing, and moving legs to chase the best yield. Your share price rises as the vault earns; when you withdraw, you burn shares and get back USDC plus your accrued yield. No positions to manage, no execution to worry about. See [Vault](/strategies/vault) for deposits, withdrawals, and risks.

## Liquidity provisioning (LP Terminal)

The **LP Terminal** is where you manage liquidity provisioning on Solana in one place. Instead of jumping between Meteora, Raydium, and multiple analytics tools, you get a single interface to create and manage LP positions across supported pool types (DAMM, DLMM, CLMM, CPMM).

You can discover pools by category and metrics, find the best pool for a token pair, automate with presets and rebalancing, set take profit and stop loss, copy other wallets’ LP positions, and track everything in one portfolio view. The goal is to make providing liquidity on Solana as simple as possible from a single platform. For details, see [LP Terminal](/lp-terminal/what).
