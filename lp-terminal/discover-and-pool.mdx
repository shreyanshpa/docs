Two pages, two different purposes. Let's break down when to use each one.

## Discover Page

**Use this when:** You're exploring and want to find the best opportunities.

The Discover page is like a curated marketplace. It shows you the pools that are performing best right now on Solana, organized by categories that make sense.

### What Makes It Special?

Instead of scrolling through hundreds of pools wondering which ones are worth your time, Discover shows you:

* **Trending Pools** - The most actively traded pairs right now
* **Smart Categories** - Filter by what matters to you
* **All the Metrics You Need** - No more opening 5 different websites:
  * Market Cap Liquidity - How much money is in this pool?
  * Lincoln Score - Is this a solid project?
  * Volatility - How much does the price move?
  * Exit Score - How easy is it to get out?

Everything is calculated and shown right here. No more copy-pasting addresses into different analytics tools.

### Pool Categories Explained

**Bluechips**

Think of these as the "safe bets" - well-known tokens with strong track records. Like the blue-chip stocks of crypto, these have proven themselves over time and typically have deep liquidity.

**Stable Pairs**

Perfect if you want less risk. These pools are made of stablecoins or low-volatility tokens. You won't see huge gains, but you also won't lose sleep over price swings.

**Ownership**

These pools are special - the liquidity providers own a significant chunk. This usually means the community is committed for the long haul, which can be a good sign.

**LST (Liquid Staking Tokens)**

This is where staking meets liquidity. You stake your tokens (like SOL) and get a liquid version back. You still earn staking rewards, but you can trade or use the token anytime. Best of both worlds.

**RWA (Real World Assets)**

Real-world stuff, but on the blockchain. Think tokenized real estate, commodities, or traditional assets. It's like bringing Wall Street to Solana.

## Pool Page

**Use this when:** You already know which token pair you want (like SOL/USDC) and need to find the best pool for it.

This is your precision tool. You've made your decision on what to provide liquidity to - now you just need to find the right pool.

### How It's Different

Discover helps you decide *what* to provide liquidity to. The Pool page helps you decide *where*.

Let's say you want to provide liquidity for SOL/USDC. The Pool page shows you:
- Every SOL/USDC pool on Meteora
- Every SOL/USDC pool on Raydium
- Side-by-side comparison with all the metrics
- Filters to narrow down exactly what you're looking for

### What You Can Do

* **Search Everything** - One search bar, both protocols
* **Filter Smart** - Find pools that match your criteria

* **Compare Easily** - See which pool has better fees, more liquidity, or better returns
* **Jump Right In** - Select a pool and start providing liquidity immediately

Think of it like shopping for a specific product - you know what you want, you just need to find the best deal. That's what the Pool page does for liquidity.
