Let's be honest - managing liquidity positions can be a full-time job if you do it manually. That's why we built automation tools that work while you sleep.

## Presets: Your Strategy Shortcuts

Ever set up a position perfectly, then wished you could just click a button to do it again? That's what presets are for.

### What You Can Save

When creating a preset, you can configure:

* **Price Range** - Set your minimum and maximum prices
* **Strategy Type** - Choose between spot or ask curve
* **Exit Points** - Define when to take profit or cut losses
* **Rebalancing** - Turn auto-rebalancing on or off

Once you've got a preset saved, using it again is literally one click. Found a strategy that works? Save it as a preset and reuse it whenever you want.

### Why This Matters

Instead of manually entering the same settings every time, presets let you:
- Deploy proven strategies instantly
- Reduce mistakes from manual entry
- Save time on repetitive tasks
- Focus on finding opportunities, not configuring positions

## Rebalancer: Your Position's Auto-Pilot

Rebalancing is like having a co-pilot that keeps your position optimized 24/7.

### What It Does

Your liquidity position can drift out of balance as prices move. Rebalancing automatically:
- Keeps your token ratios optimal
- Reduces impermanent loss
- Protects you during volatile markets
- Maximizes your returns without you lifting a finger

### How It Works

Think of it like cruise control for your car, but for liquidity positions. Once enabled:
1. Our system monitors your position continuously
2. When it drifts out of balance, it automatically adjusts
3. You get a small fee charged per rebalance (worth it for the peace of mind)
4. Your position stays optimized without you checking constantly

The best part? It runs automatically in the background. Set it and forget it.

### Why You'll Love It

- **Less Stress** - No need to watch your positions every hour
- **Better Returns** - Positions stay optimized automatically
- **Protection** - Reduces risk during market volatility
- **Time Savings** - Focus on other things while it works

## Take Profit and Stop Loss: Your Safety Net

Nobody wants to watch their screen 24/7. TP/SL lets you set your exit strategy and walk away.

### Two Types to Choose From

**1. PnL-Based (Profit & Loss)**

Set it based on how much you've made or lost. For example:
- "Close this position if I make 20% profit"
- "Exit if I lose more than 10%"

**2. Pool Price-Based**

Set it based on the pool's price movements:
- "Close if the price goes above $X"
- "Exit if the price drops below $Y"

### Why This Is Game-Changing

Before automation, you had to:
- Constantly monitor your positions
- Make decisions under pressure
- Risk missing your exit point
- Stress about checking prices

Now you can:
- Set your targets and relax
- Let the system handle exits automatically
- Sleep better knowing you're protected
- Focus on finding new opportunities

### Real Talk

Setting TP/SL is like setting an alarm - you know it'll wake you up (or in this case, close your position) at the right time. It's one of those features you don't realize you need until you use it, then you can't imagine trading without it.
