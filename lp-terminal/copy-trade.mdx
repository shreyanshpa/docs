# Copy Trade

Ever wish you could just copy what the successful traders are doing? Now you can.

## What Is Copy Trading?

It's exactly what it sounds like - find a wallet that's making great liquidity moves, and copy their positions automatically. No need to figure out their strategy or manually replicate what they're doing.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Find a Wallet

See someone crushing it with their liquidity positions? Just grab their wallet address.

### Step 2: Choose Your Allocation

You have two options:

**Fixed Amount**
- "I want to put exactly 5 SOL into this copied position"
- Simple and straightforward

**Percentage**
- "I want 20% of my wallet to follow this strategy"
- Automatically scales with your wallet size

### Step 3: Let It Work

Our system automatically:
- Swaps your SOL into the right token ratios
- Creates the same positions they have
- Keeps everything proportional to their strategy
- Updates when they make changes

## Why This Is Powerful

### Learn From the Best

Instead of trial and error, you can:
- Follow wallets that consistently perform well
- Learn what strategies work by seeing them in action
- Build your own knowledge while earning

### Diversify Easily

You can copy multiple wallets at once. This means:
- Spread your risk across different strategies
- Follow different traders for different approaches
- Build a diversified portfolio without the research time

### Save Time

No more:
- Researching which pools to enter
- Calculating token ratios
- Manually creating positions
- Monitoring multiple strategies

Just find successful wallets and copy them. It's that simple.

## What You Get

When you copy trade, you get:

* **Dedicated View** - See all your copied positions in one place
* **Activity Tracking** - Watch what the wallets you're following are doing
* **Easy Management** - Add or remove wallets anytime
* **Proportional Exposure** - Your positions match theirs, scaled to your size

## Real Example

Let's say you find a wallet that's been consistently profitable with SOL/USDC positions. Instead of:
1. Analyzing their strategy
2. Figuring out their price ranges
3. Manually creating the same positions
4. Monitoring and adjusting

You just:
1. Copy their wallet
2. Choose how much to allocate
3. Done

The system handles everything else. You get the same positions, automatically maintained, without the work.

## The Bottom Line

Copy trading is like having a mentor who shows you exactly what to do, but you're actually making money while learning. It's perfect for beginners who want to start earning while they learn, and for experienced traders who want to diversify their strategies.
