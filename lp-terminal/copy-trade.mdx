Ever wish you could just copy what the successful traders are doing? Now you can.

## What Is Copy Trading?

It's exactly what it sounds like - find a wallet that's making great liquidity moves, and copy their positions automatically. No need to figure out their strategy or manually replicate what they're doing.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Find a Wallet

See someone crushing it with their liquidity positions? Just grab their wallet address.

### Step 2: Choose Your Allocation

You have two options:

**Fixed Amount**
- "I want to put exactly 5 SOL into this copied position"
- Simple and straightforward

**Percentage**
- "I want 20% of my wallet to follow this strategy"
- Automatically scales with your wallet size

### Step 3: Let It Work

Our system automatically:
- Swaps your SOL into the right token ratios
- Creates the same positions they have
- Keeps everything proportional to their strategy
- Updates when they make changes

## Why This Is Powerful

Copy trading lets you learn from successful traders while earning. Instead of spending hours researching pools, calculating ratios, and manually creating positions, you can follow wallets that consistently perform well and automatically replicate their strategies. You can copy multiple wallets at once to diversify your risk across different approaches, all while building your knowledge by seeing what works in real-time. The system handles everything - from swapping tokens to maintaining positions - giving you a dedicated view of all copied positions with activity tracking.
