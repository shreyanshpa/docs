Your one-stop shop for everything you own. No more switching between Meteora and Raydium to see your positions.

## What You'll See

Open the Portfolio and you'll instantly see:

* **All Your Positions** - Every single liquidity position, regardless of type
* **Where They Are** - Which protocol (Meteora or Raydium) each one is on
* **How They're Doing** - Real-time performance tracking
* **Smart Tags** - See which positions are copied, which hit take profit, which hit stop loss
* **Everything in One Place** - No more mental math or switching tabs

## Position Types You'll Find

We track all the different types of liquidity positions:

* **CLMM** (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) - Focused range positions with concentrated liquidity
* **DLMM** (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) - Adaptive liquidity positions that adjust dynamically
* **AMM** - Classic constant product liquidity positions

It doesn't matter if you created them on Meteora, Raydium, or through Paystream - they all show up here.

## How We Track Everything

We built our own indexer that watches both Meteora and Raydium. This means:
- We see positions in real-time
- No delays or missing data
- Accurate tracking across all protocols
- You don't need to connect multiple wallets

## The Activity Tab: Your History

Want to see what happened last week? Last month? The Activity tab has your back.

### What's Inside

* **Opened Positions** - Every position you've ever created
* **Closed Positions** - What you've exited and when
* **All Your Actions** - Every move you've made
* **Profit & Loss** - Your complete PnL history

### Why This Matters

Before Paystream, tracking your history meant:
- Exporting data from multiple platforms
- Using spreadsheets to calculate PnL
- Manually tracking what worked and what didn't
- Losing track of positions you forgot about

Now it's all here. Want to see how much you made last month? Click Activity. Want to review a strategy that worked? It's all there.

## What You Can Do

From the Portfolio, you can:

* **Close Positions** - Exit any position with one click
* **Claim Fees** - Collect your earned fees
* **Add Liquidity** - Top up existing positions
* **View Details** - See everything about each position
* **Track Performance** - Watch your profits grow

## Looking Ahead

As we add more features (like leverage and advanced strategies), your Portfolio will grow with them. It's designed to be your central hub for everything liquidity-related, now and in the future. Portfolio is like your personal dashboard for liquidity - instead of checking 5 different places, everything you need to know is right here. Your positions, your history, your performance - all in one place, all the time.
