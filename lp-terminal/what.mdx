# LP Terminal

Ever felt overwhelmed managing your liquidity positions across different platforms? Paystream LP Terminal is here to change that.

Think of it as your all-in-one command center for providing liquidity on Solana. Instead of jumping between Meteora, Raydium, and multiple analytics tools, everything you need is right here in one place.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Before Paystream, providing liquidity meant:
- Opening multiple browser tabs for different platforms
- Using separate tools just to see your analytics
- Manually tracking which pools are performing well
- Constantly switching apps to manage your positions

Sound familiar? We've been there too. That's why we built the LP Terminal to bring everything together.

## What Can You Do?

With the LP Terminal, you can:

* **Create positions** - Set up new liquidity positions in seconds
* **Manage everything** - All your positions in one dashboard
* **Get smart insights** - See analytics and scores without leaving the platform
* **Discover pools** - Find the best opportunities with curated recommendations
* **Automate strategies** - Set it and forget it with presets and auto-rebalancing
* **Copy successful traders** - Learn from the best by copying their positions
* **Track your performance** - See your profits and losses across all positions

Our goal? Make providing liquidity on Solana as simple as checking your email.

## Supported Pool Types

You can work with all the major pool types you'll find on Solana:

* **DAMM** (Dynamic AMM) - Flexible pools that adapt to market conditions
* **DLMM** (Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker) - Smart liquidity distribution
* **CLMM** (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) - Focused liquidity ranges
* **CPMM** (Constant Product Market Maker) - Classic AMM pools

Whether you're on Raydium or Meteora, we've got you covered. No need to learn different interfaces - it all works the same way here.

## Native Integrations

We're directly connected to:

* **Meteora** - Full access to all their pools
* **Raydium** - Complete integration with their platform

What does this mean for you? You never have to leave Paystream. Create positions, check analytics, manage your portfolio - it all happens right here. No more switching tabs or copying addresses between platforms.
