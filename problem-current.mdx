Let's talk about the problems we're solving. We've all been there - dealing with platforms that don't quite work the way we need them to.

## Lending Protocols

### The APY Spread Problem

**The Problem:** On platforms like Kamino, when there aren't many borrowers, your money just sits there earning almost nothing. But when someone does borrow, they're paying high interest rates. So lenders get low returns while borrowers pay too much. It's a lose-lose situation.

**Our Solution:** We match borrowers and lenders directly. No middleman taking a cut. You get better rates, they get better rates. Everyone wins.

### The Locked Funds Problem

**The Problem:** Most platforms lock your money for a set period. Need your funds back early? Too bad. This doesn't work for people who need flexibility - freelancers, DAOs, or anyone with unpredictable cash flow.

**Our Solution:** Withdraw anytime. Even if your money is currently being borrowed, we'll find liquidity from other sources. Your money, your control.

### The Idle Collateral Problem

**The Problem:** When you borrow, you have to put up collateral. That collateral just sits there doing nothing. You're essentially paying to borrow your own money that's locked away earning zero.

**Our Solution:** Your collateral works for you. We route it to high-yield pools so it earns while backing your loan. Your money never sits idle.

## Liquidity Provisioning Layer

### The Fragmentation Problem

**The Problem:** Want to provide liquidity? You'll need:
- One app to create positions
- Another app to see analytics
- A third tool to track performance
- Multiple tabs open just to manage one position

It's exhausting. You spend more time switching between apps than actually managing your positions.

**Our Solution:** Everything in one place. Create positions, see analytics, track performance, discover pools - it's all here. One platform, zero tab-switching.

### The Manual Work Problem

**The Problem:** Managing liquidity positions is like having a second job. You need to:
- Constantly check your positions
- Manually rebalance when prices move
- Set take profit and stop loss levels
- Monitor everything across different protocols

One mistake and you could lose money. The stress is real.

**Our Solution:** Automation that works while you sleep. Save your strategies as presets and reuse them with one click. Auto-rebalancing keeps your positions optimized. Set your TP/SL and walk away. We handle the busy work.

### The Analytics Problem

**The Problem:** Want to know if a pool is worth your time? You'll need to:
- Visit multiple websites
- Calculate scores manually
- Compare data from different sources
- Hope you're making the right decision

By the time you figure it out, the opportunity might be gone.

**Our Solution:** All the metrics you need, right here. Market Cap Liquidity, Lincoln Score, Volatility, Exit Score - we calculate everything and show it to you. No more research, just decisions.

### The Scattered Portfolio Problem

**The Problem:** Your positions are everywhere. Some on Meteora, some on Raydium. To see everything you own, you need to:
- Log into multiple platforms
- Remember which positions are where
- Manually track your total PnL
- Hope you didn't forget about any positions

It's like having money in 10 different bank accounts with no way to see your total balance.

**Our Solution:** One portfolio view for everything. All your positions across all protocols, all in one place. See your total performance, track your history, manage everything from one dashboard. Simple.
