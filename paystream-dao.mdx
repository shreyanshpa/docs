# Paystream (PAYS) Protocol Documentation

## Governance & Ownership Overview

Paystream is governed by **Futarchy**, a model that utilizes prediction markets to authorize decisions based on their projected impact on the PAYS token value. Instead of traditional popularity-based voting, proposals are executed only if the market predicts a positive price outcome.

The protocol is legally registered as a **Marshall Islands DAO LLC**. This structure guarantees that all intellectual property, revenue streams, and treasury assets are owned directly by the company—and effectively, the PAYS token holders—rather than the founding team.

## Token Launch & Supply

The PAYS token launched via a fair auction mechanism on [MetaDAO](https://metadao.fi) to align distribution with long-term value creation.

### Launch Mechanics

- **Hard Cap:** $750,000
- **Initial Price:** $0.075 (Initial FDV: $1,856,250)
- **Oversubscription:** The launch received over $6.1M in commitments. Due to the cap, participants were refunded approximately **87.8%** of their committed USDC.
- **Liquidity:** **20%** of raised funds were permanently allocated to protocol liquidity.

### Supply & Team Covenant

- **Total Supply:** 25,000,000 PAYS
- **Team Lock-up:** The team allocation is bound by a strict performance-based covenant:
  - **18-Month Cliff:** Tokens are fully locked for 1.5 years.
  - **Performance Tranches:** After the cliff, tokens vest in **20% tranches** only if the PAYS price hits specific multipliers of the launch price ($0.15, $0.30, $0.45).

## How Futarchy Works

Paystream removes political friction by replacing voting with financial incentives. [Learn more about Futarchy](https://docs.metadao.fi/governance/overview).

### Decision Mechanism

Every proposal creates two prediction markets:

1. **Pass Market:** The price of PAYS if the proposal passes.
2. **Fail Market:** The price of PAYS if the proposal fails.

If the "Pass" market trades higher than the "Fail" market, the proposal is automatically executed on-chain.

### Governance Parameters

- **Pass Threshold:** **150 bps (1.5%)**. The "Pass" price must exceed the "Fail" price by 1.5%.
- **Review Period:** **3 Days** (259,200 seconds).
- **TWAP Delay:** **1 Day**. Price calculations begin 24 hours after creation to prevent manipulation.
- **Proposer Stake:** **500,000 PAYS**. Required to submit a proposal.
- **Operational Spending:** The DAO has a pre-authorized limit of **33,500 USDC per month** for recurring operational costs.

### Legal & Asset Enforcement

- **Entity Status:** The DAO is a recognized legal entity, allowing it to enter contracts and limiting member liability.
- **IP Ownership:** Every IP is owned by the DAO LLC, controlled by the DAO. The **[Founder Covenant](https://www.paystream.finance/Covenant.pdf)** legally binds the founder to transfer all assets (domains, GitHub, Socials) to the DAO LLC within 60 days of launch.
- **Treasury Control:** All revenue flows to the Treasury (`BpXtB2ASf2Tft97ewTd8PayXCqFQ6Wqod33qrwwfK9Vz`). If the covenant is breached, the DAO can restrict the team's access to funds.
