## Governance & Ownership Overview

Paystream is governed by **Futarchy**, a model that utilizes prediction markets to authorize decisions based on their projected impact on the PAYS token value. Instead of traditional popularity-based voting, proposals are executed only if the market predicts a positive price outcome.

The protocol is legally registered as a **Marshall Islands DAO LLC**. This structure guarantees that all intellectual property, revenue streams, and treasury assets are owned directly by the company and effectively, the PAYS token holders rather than the founding team.

## Token Launch & Supply

The PAYS token launched via a fair auction mechanism on [MetaDAO](https://metadao.fi) to align distribution with long-term value creation.

### Launch Mechanics

- **Hard Cap:** $750,000
- **Initial Price:** $0.075 (Initial FDV: $1,856,250)
- **Oversubscription:** The launch received over $6.1M in commitments. Due to the cap, participants were refunded approximately **87.8%** of their committed USDC.
- **Liquidity:** **20%** of raised funds were permanently allocated to protocol liquidity.

### Supply & Team Covenant

- **Total Supply at Launch:** 24.75 million tokens, allocated as follows:
  - **10 million** for the ICO at a fixed price for all participants
  - **2.9 million** for liquidity, including 2 million paired with 20% of funds raised and 900,000 as single-sided liquidity on Meteora
  - **11.85 million** for the team and early contributors, locked for 18 months and unlocked based on performance milestones
- **Team Lock-up:** The team allocation is bound by a strict performance-based covenant:
  - **18-Month Cliff:** Tokens are fully locked for 1.5 years.
  - **Performance Tranches:** This package is split into 5 equal tranches: one that unlocks at 2x ICO price, one that unlocks at 4x ICO price, and so on for 8x, 16x, and 32x. Each tranche contains 2,370,000 tokens and unlocks when the PAYS price reaches:
    - **$0.15** (2x ICO price) - 2,370,000 tokens
    - **$0.30** (4x ICO price) - 2,370,000 tokens
    - **$0.60** (8x ICO price) - 2,370,000 tokens
    - **$1.20** (16x ICO price) - 2,370,000 tokens
    - **$2.40** (32x ICO price) - 2,370,000 tokens

## How Futarchy Works

Paystream removes political friction by replacing voting with financial incentives. [Learn more about Futarchy](https://docs.metadao.fi/governance/overview).

### Decision Mechanism

Every proposal creates two prediction markets:

1. **Pass Market:** The price of PAYS if the proposal passes.
2. **Fail Market:** The price of PAYS if the proposal fails.

If the "Pass" market trades higher than the "Fail" market, the proposal is automatically executed on-chain.

### Governance Parameters

- **Pass Threshold:** **150 bps (1.5%)**. The "Pass" price must exceed the "Fail" price by 1.5%.
- **Review Period:** **3 Days** (259,200 seconds).
- **TWAP Delay:** **1 Day**. Price calculations begin 24 hours after creation to prevent manipulation.
- **Proposer Stake:** **500,000 PAYS**. Required to submit a proposal.
- **Operational Spending:** The DAO has a pre-authorized limit of **33,500 USDC per month** for recurring operational costs.

### Legal & Asset Enforcement

- **Entity Status:** The DAO is a recognized legal entity, allowing it to enter contracts and limiting member liability.
- **IP Ownership:** Every IP is owned by the DAO LLC, controlled by the DAO. The **[Founder Covenant](https://www.paystream.finance/Covenant.pdf)** legally binds the founder to transfer all assets (domains, GitHub, Socials) to the DAO LLC within 60 days of launch.
- **Treasury Control:** All revenue flows to the Treasury (`BpXtB2ASf2Tft97ewTd8PayXCqFQ6Wqod33qrwwfK9Vz`). If the covenant is breached, the DAO can restrict the team's access to funds.
